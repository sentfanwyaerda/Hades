Hades
=====
*Webapplication Platform*

**Hades** &mdash; "The Underworld" (the realm of the afterlife), or personified as the god reigning it, in greek mythology. Within the 'backbox'-paradigma of software development is there way more then just the functionality of the desired application. **Hades** is trying to bring all those 'entities' easily accessable available to its applications, with all flexibility, while being the dreamy clear enigma a client/user wants it to be. 

### Requires:
- PHP 5
- Apache (for ``.htaccess``)
- Git (<em>if</em> platform-wide version management is enabled, through commandline)
